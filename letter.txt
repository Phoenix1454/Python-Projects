Dear Sir,

As per our recent conversation, please accept this letter as a formal request for your permission to hold a mock crash at St. Anselm's Sr. Sec. School on 15/07/2022. The initiative will educate students about the positive role that seat belts play in trac crashes and about the consequences of drinking and driving.

Once your approval has been obtained, we will be arranging for a wrecked vehicle to be towed to the school on 15/07/2022. Please note that we will be taking care of all other details pertaining to the setup of the “mock crash” as well.

It is our understanding that you will ensure that this does not contravene any guidelines set by our school board. If you have any questions or wish to meet to discuss the “crash” in further detail, please contact me or our sponsor teacher, Rajnikant.

Thank you for allowing us this opportunity to help get our very important traffic safety message across to our fellow
students.

Sincerely,
SLS
